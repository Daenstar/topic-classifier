We are proud of our alumni! \ud83e\udd70\n\nViru Keemia Grupp\n8 July 2020 at 14:01 \u00b7\n\n\ud83d\udc77Get to know - Gunnar Joonas. Gunnar worked for Viru Keemia Grupp for 5 years before moving to Germany to work for a global technology company. We asked him to describe his career at VKG and asked if and how working at VKG helped him get his current job.\n\n\"I started my career at VKG as an automation system maintenance worker in February 2012. After a few months, I was increasingly involved in design work. As soon as the Petroter II project went green, I was assigned to an automation project team and only worked in design. Shortly after the end of the project, I started working in the Petroter III project team.\nThe aforementioned major projects and countless smaller side projects brought a huge amount of experience and knowledge. There I had the honor of collaborating with the best and smartest colleagues. I also took an extremely positive experience from VKG in the form of a nice team.\n\nI worked at VKG for a little over five years. The plan was to learn as quickly as possible and as much as possible, as this is an extremely interesting profession and every professional should learn something new every day to keep up with new technical trends. The main goal was not to get to the highest position, but to make the job interesting. That was for me and is still the main driver.\n\nI am currently an automation project manager at a large international design and manufacturing company. The experience gained at VKG has been enormous, as the experience gained in the oil industry is doubly worthwhile in other industries. \"\n#VKG #VKGs #careers inVKGs\n_______________________\n\ud83d\udc77\u0417\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0413\u0443\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0440. \u0414\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0432 \u0433\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435 \ud83c\udf0d, \u043e\u043d 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 We have been able to compete with the general government in VKG and in the country, the company has been in charge of VKG.\n\n\"\u042f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043a\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0432 VKG \u0432 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0435 2012 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432 \u044f \u0447\u0430\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0439. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 Petroter II \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442, \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043b \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 Site Manager \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u0412\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u044f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435 Petroter III.\nComprehensive tests and tests It is appropriate to list the products and the total number of items.

Gunnar worked for Viru Keemia Grupp for 5 years before moving to Germany to work for a global technology company. We asked him to describe his career at VKG and asked if and how working at VKG helped him get his current job.\n\n\"I started my career at VKG as an automation system maintenance worker in February 2012. After a few months, I was increasingly involved in design work. As soon as the Petroter II project went green, I was assigned to an automation project team and only worked in design. Shortly after the end of the project, I started working in the Petroter III project team.\nThe aforementioned major projects and countless smaller side projects brought a huge amount of experience and knowledge. There I had the honor of collaborating with the best and smartest colleagues. I also took an extremely positive experience from VKG in the form of a nice team.\n\nI worked at VKG for a little over five years. The plan was to learn as quickly as possible and as much as possible, as this is an extremely interesting profession and every professional should learn something new every day to keep up with new technical trends. The main goal was not to get to the highest position, but to make the job interesting. That was for me and is still the main driver.\n\nI am currently an automation project manager at a large international design and manufacturing company.

My first education is related to environmental science, my second is economics. I had never worked in production, I didn't even know what was ahead of me. Then I started studying. Weeks passed, then months, and practice awaited. I researched a bit of the background, it turned out that right next to it is the world class chemical industry.

I expressed my wish to work for VKG. I became the operator of a defenolator. Since I felt that I missed my vocational education, I went to TUT Virumaa College to study for a master's degree in fuel chemistry and technology.

Riisalu admits that excessive carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are becoming a serious environmental problem and have triggered climate panic and made environmental protection a profitable industry in its own right.\nUnsorted, unwashed waste with different components has little to do but incinerate. In practice, however, the alternative is to use pyrolysis, or heating without atmospheric oxygen, to produce gas, oil and semi-coke.\nPKK studies show that pyrolysis of 100% plastic waste varies greatly depending on the composition of the waste. The result of the co-pyrolysis process of oil shale and waste is successful up to a ratio of 50:50. The process of co-pyrolysis of residual oil shale products (crushed stone, ash, semi-coke), sand and plastic waste may allow the use of up to 80% plastic waste in the mixture for some components.\nThank you, Hella Riisalu, for inviting me to think out of the frame!", "likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 0, "time": "2019-11-13"}

The thorns and leaves of the trees are larger than in unfertilized areas. The use of oil shale ash as a fertilizer binds CO2 emissions due to plants.

TalTech professor Alar Konist explains that oil shale ash does not differ (negatively) from coal ash. Yes, oil shale ash is dangerous, but not more dangerous than coal ash. Coal ash is not considered a hazardous waste in the EU and America. As oil shale ash must be treated as hazardous waste in Estonia, it makes it significantly more difficult to recover it compared to non-hazardous waste.\nUsing oil shale in CO2 neutrality - an insurmountable problem or opportunity? Oil shale burning is not only for electricity production but also for oil production. The result depends on the technology. In addition, an environmental impact and life cycle analysis is needed.\nShould CO2 be used for chemicals or rather buried? From an ethical point of view, it would probably be more appropriate to use it, but it must be assessed that no greater damage is done to the environment.\nThank you, Professor Konist, for sharing your knowledge.", "likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 0, "time": "2019-11-13"}

I attended the state gymnasium in both cities and met with the school management. J\u00f5hvi State Gymnasium has been running well for four years, because there are far more people who want to study at the school than there are places. The main criterion for admission is proficiency in the Estonian language. However, Kohtla-J\u00e4rve State Gymnasium, which has been operating for the first weeks, is still trying to break taboos and convince parents that education in Estonian will create a more secure future for their children. The main issue in the coming years will be the level of Estonian language education in basic schools. I think that one of the possibilities could be to consider the nationalization of basic schools on the example of upper secondary schools, even as a pilot project in Ida-Virumaa. At TalTech Virumaa College in Kohtla-J\u00e4rve, I met with lecturers and got acquainted with the school.

{"post_id": "1752475081524028", "text": "Thank you, Maris Lauri, for your direct questions and clear message.\n\nMaris Lauri\n9 January 2019 at 19:30 \u00b7\n\nI submitted a written question to the Minister of Education and Research on upper secondary education in Ida-Virumaa. Narva does not want to come to the state gymnasium, the results of the state exams of J\u00f5hvi gymnasium could be better and now a number of questions have arisen about the state gymnasium to be built in Kohtla-J\u00e4rve. I hope that the questions of a member of the Riigikogu will make the Minister look for a solution to his problems.\nBut the questions are:\n1. What has the Ministry of Education and Research done as a school operator to improve the quality of teaching at J\u00f5hvi Gymnasium? What efforts have been made to strengthen the management of the school and to find teachers with a very good command of Estonian?\n2. In what condition is the construction of a state gymnasium in Narva? What have you done as a minister over the past year to get the state gymnasium to Narva?\n3. Why was it decided to establish a state gymnasium in Kohtla-J\u00e4rve, even though there is already another state gymnasium nearby and due to the declining population it may be difficult to find enough students in several state gymnasiums? Was the decision taken into account the fact that it is difficult to find teachers who are fluent in Estonian and whose mother tongue is Estonian, and it would be more expedient to develop one strong upper secondary school with all the necessary teachers who also have a sufficient workload? When making the decision, were the possible negative effects of the closure of Kohtla-J\u00e4rve J\u00e4rve Gymnasium as a very strong Estonian-language gymnasium on the Estonian community and the emigration of Estonians from the region due to the decrease in good educational opportunities assessed?\n4. What is the idea of \u200b\u200bthe future of Kohtla-J\u00e4rve State Gymnasium as a representative of the Minister of Education and Research as a school administrator? Please provide precise explanations regarding the fields of study and the language of instruction, as well as how it is planned to find teachers with a high level of professional Estonian or mother tongue in the new upper secondary school in an area where finding such teachers has been a problem for decades?\n5. The local community has repeatedly pointed out that the principal of the new state gymnasium does not address the substantive issues necessary for the opening of the gymnasium: has not met with local, potential parents, has not been able to present a clear vision of possible fields of study, etc. What does the Minister intend to do to ensure that the principal of the upper secondary school takes over the management of the upper secondary school?\n6. Does and when does the school teacher meet the local Estonian-speaking community and become interested in real developments, rather than apparently accepting the reassuring but inadequate messages presented by the principal, which seek to hide the local people's real concern for children's education and the survival of the Estonian community?", "likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 0, "time": "2019-01-09"}
